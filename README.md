# Spring Security Demo and Walkthrough

Spring Security Demo using the In-Memory database.

<b><i>About / Disclaimer:</i></b> This walkthrough is designed to help those start from a beginning project up to a point where they
    can stop at the preferred method for their project. This project uses the free Amigos Code "Spring Security" course taught by Mamba
    Samba Braima, also known as Nelson, at https://www.amigoscode.com/p/spring-boot-security. I claim no rights on this code. Any
    intellectual property rights belong to him, and the associated rights belong to Amigos Code. Although some of the code has been
    changed, it was only to allow for functionality and personal preference due to modifications to the Java programming language and
    Spring Framework since the course's creation.

Project followed the "Spring Security Course" offered by Mamba Samba Braima (AKA Nelson) at AmigosCode.
